TODO: Deployment with Kubernetes on Google Cloud Engine
===

## Advantages

- Kubernetes is easier to use than ECS
- Integrated load balancing allowing expensive heroku dynos to be replaced
- Far easier to auto-scale
- GCP offers much better I/O than AWS with EBS

## Issues

- Lack of AWS lambda equivalent (Google cloud functions only support NodeJS) 
- Expensive GPUs
