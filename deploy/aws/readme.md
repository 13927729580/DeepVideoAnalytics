# Distributed deployment on AWS

This directory **used to** contain scripts and files required for a distributed deployment
of Deep Video Analytics using Heroku, AWS ECS, EFS and S3. However we have decided to support 
**Kubernetes alone**. Code in this directory will be updated when Kubernetes becomes available on AWS in 2018. 
Meanwhile please take a look at /gcp for distributed deployment using Google Kubernetes Engines & GCS.
